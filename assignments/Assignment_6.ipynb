    "Your goal is to develop a reinforcement learning technique to learn the optimal policy for winning at blackjack through trial-and-error learning. Here, we're going to modify the rules from traditional blackjack a bit in a way that corresponds to the game presented in Sutton and Barto's *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* (Chapter 5, example 5.1). A full implementation of the game is provided and usage examples are detailed in the class header below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of this modified version of the game of blackjack are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to obtain cards that sum to as near as possible to 21 without going over.  We're playing against a fixed (autonomous) dealer.\n",
    "- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) have point value 10. Aces can either count as 11 or 1 (whichever is most advantageous to the player), and we're refer to it as a 'usable' Ace if we're treating it as 11 (indicating that it could be used as a '1', instead, if need be). This game is played with a deck of cards sampled with replacement.\n",
    "- The game starts with both the player and the dealer having one face up and one face down card.\n",
    "- The player can request additional cards (known as taking a \"hit\", which we define as action \"1\") until either they decide to stop (known as \"staying\", which we define as action '0') or their cards exceed 21 (known as a \"bust\", at which time the game ends and player loses).\n",
    "- If the player stays (and hasn't exceeded a score of 21), the dealer reveals their facedown card, and draws until their sum is 17 or greater. If the dealer busts the player wins. If neither player nor dealer busts, the outcome (win, lose, draw) is decided by whose sum is closer to 21.  The reward for winning is +1, tying is 0, and losing is -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of these exercises, you will accomplish three things:\n",
    "1. Try your hand at this game of blackjack and see what your human reinforcement learning system is able to achieve\n",
    "2. Evaluate a naive policy using Monte Carlo policy evaluation\n",
    "3. Determine an optimal policy using Monte Carlo control\n",
    "\n",

    "Using the code detailed below, play at least 20 hands of the modified blackjack game below, and record your returns (average cumulative reward) across all episodes. This will help you get accustomed with how the game works, the data structures involved with representing states, and what strategies are most effective. Since for this game, you only get a nonzero reward at the end of the episode, you can simply play the game and note the reward in a spreadsheet, then average across all plays of the game (of course, you're welcome to code up a way to do that automatically if you're so inspired)."

    "\n",
    "Now it's time to actually implement a reinforcement learning strategy that learns to play this version of Blackjack well, only through trial-and-error learning. Here, you will develop your Monte Carlo Control algorithm and evaluate its performance for our Blackjack-like game.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** Using Monte Carlo Control through policy iteration, estimate the optimal policy for playing our modified blackjack game to maximize rewards. \n",
    "\n",
    "In doing this, use the following assumptions:\n",
    "1. Initialize the state value function and the action value function to all zeros\n",
    "2. Keep a running tally of the number of times the agent visited each state and chose an action. $N(s_t,a_t)$ is the number of times action $a$ has been selected from state $s$. You'll need this to compute the running average. You can implement an online average as: $\\bar{x}_{t} = \\frac{1}{N}x_t + \\frac{N-1}{N}\\bar{x}_{t-1}$ \n",
    "3. Use an $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy with $\\epsilon_t = \\frac{N_0}{N_0 + N(s_t)}$, where we define $N_0 = 100$. Vary $N_0$ as needed. Varying $0 \\leq N_0 < \\inf$ will determine the amount of exploration the algorithm performs where the lower $N_0$ the less exploration and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show your results by plotting the optimal state value function: $v^*(s) = \\max_a q^*(s,a)$ and the optimal policy $\\pi^*(s)$. Create plots for these similar to Sutton and Barto, Figure 5.2 in the 2018 edition (5.5 in the original edition) - sample code provided for the plots. Your results SHOULD be very similar to the plots in that text (although you will show your results with the player sum ranging from 2 to 21). For these plots include the following (note - code from the previous section of this assignment for state value function plotting and below for policy plotting are provided to help you to accomplish these):\n",
    "1. When you have a useable ace, plot the value function with the dealer's card on the x-axis, and the player's sum on the y-axis, and use the colormap and `imshow` to plot the value function that corresponds with those states. Plot the state value corresponding to each state under the policy described above. The domain of your x and y axes should include all possible states (2 to 21 for the player sum, and 1 to 10 for the dealer's visible card).\n",
    "2. Repeat (1) for the same states but without a usable ace.\n",
    "3. Plot the optimal policy $\\pi^*(s)$ for the states with a usable ace (this plot can be an imshow plot with binary values - sample code provided).\n",
    "4. Plot the optimal policy $\\pi^*(s)$ for the states without a usable ace (this plot can be an imshow plot with binary values - sample code provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Plot the cumulative average return per episode vs the number of episodes (your x-axis should be log-scaled to clearly see the trend). What is the average return your control strategy was able to achieve? You'll know your method is working if you see a steady rise in your average returns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note on convergence: convergence of this algorithm is extremely slow. You may need to let this run a few million episodes before the policy starts to converge. You're not expected to get EXACTLY the optimal policy, but it should be visibly close.* \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note on sample code: the code provided for these questions is meant to be a helpful starting point - you are not required to fill it out exactly or use all components, but it is meant to help you as you begin thinking about this problem.*"
