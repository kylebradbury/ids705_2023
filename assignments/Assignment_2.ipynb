We'll use the `sklearn` convention that a supervised learning algorithm has the methods `fit` which trains your algorithm (for KNN that means storing the data) and `predict` which identifies the K nearest neighbors and determines the most common class among those K neighbors. *Note: Most classification algorithms typically also have a method `predict_proba` which outputs the confidence score of each prediction, but we will explore that in a later assignment.*\n",

For each of these datasets there are $n=1000$ observations of each. They can be found in the `data` subfolder in the `assignments` folder on github.

Linear regression can be used to model nonlinear relationships when feature variables are properly transformed to represent the nonlinearities in the data. In this exercise, you're given training and test data contained in files \"A2_Q7_train.csv\" and \"A2_Q7_test.csv\" in the \"data\" folder for this assignment.

Here $z_i$ could be any transformations of x - perhaps it's $\\frac{1}{x}$, $log(x)$, $sin(x)$, $x^k$ (where $k$ is any power of your choosing). Provide the estimated equation for this multiple regression model (e.g. if you chose your predictors to be $z_1 = x$ and $z_2 = log(x)$, your model would be of the form $y = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 log(x)$.
